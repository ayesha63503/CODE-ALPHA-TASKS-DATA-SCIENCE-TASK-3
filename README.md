Predicting used car prices using machine learning regression models in Python.
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Model

## 🧠 Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict car prices based on features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine capacity.  
The goal is to understand which factors most influence car prices and to build a reliable predictive model using regression techniques.
